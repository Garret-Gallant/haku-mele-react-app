# Haku Mele

This site was made entirely in `React.JS`

The data base is hosted locally, and will be migrated to a seperate URL in the future to improve performance, as well as allow the database to be crowdsourced with more data from visiting users.

-Sort songs by artist, genre, name, etc.
-Add a new song to the database.
